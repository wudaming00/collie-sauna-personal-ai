# WHY a bundle at all, when `pip install collie-harness` already works: identity. macOS attaches
# TCC permissions (Screen Recording, Camera, Microphone) to the *application*, so a pip install
# means `collie record` asks your terminal to be granted screen recording — the terminal then holds
# blanket screen access forever, and System Settings lists "Terminal", not Collie. A bundle asks as
# Collie, and the desktop wallpaper stops showing up in the window list as "Python".
#
# Without --bundle-python this is the DEVELOPER bundle: it runs the collie already on this machine.
# With it, build_mac_payload.sh stages a private CPython inside the app (the counterpart of
# build_payload.ps1) so it runs on a Mac that has never had Python.
