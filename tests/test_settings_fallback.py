"""A settings read that fails must not quietly become "nothing was ever saved".

From one conversation that went wrong in a way nobody could see. Seven turns answered normally,
then `push` came back with canned "Based on the tool output:" text — twice, verbatim — and the
commit it described had never been pushed. settings.json was correct on disk the whole time and
the Settings panel reported the right provider throughout.

The path: _load() blanked its cache on ANY read failure while leaving the cached mtime at the
last good value, so the next call saw an unchanged mtime, skipped the reload, and served {} for
the rest of the process's life. One transient failure — an atomic panel save racing a reader, a
scanner holding the file for a moment — latched permanently. apply() then popped every
COLLIE_<KEY> it had injected, and webapp._provider() answered the way it used to: "mock".

Two independent things had to be true for a fixture to reach a person as an answer. Both are
tested here: a failed read keeps what it had, and an unconfigured provider refuses instead of
inventing one.
