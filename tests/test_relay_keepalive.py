"""A relay socket that stopped answering must be noticed.

Pinging proves nothing. A TCP socket stays writable long after the far end has stopped treating it as
this room's agent, so every ping succeeds, nothing raises, and the desktop reports `connected: true`
while the relay answers "desktop offline" to the phone. Observed exactly that today: the desktop
insisted it was connected, both relay hostnames said offline, and a manual disable/enable fixed it
instantly. Nothing on the desktop could have told you.

The far end's PONG is the only evidence anyone is listening.
