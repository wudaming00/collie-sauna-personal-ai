"""webapp._notify_done — when a finished run is worth interrupting someone for.

A notification that fires for every run is one people turn off, and once it is off the phone is back
to being a screen you have to remember to check. So the rule has to be defensible: a run you waited
for, or a run that failed. This pins that rule, and pins the things a notification must never do —
throw, or fire when nobody is paired.
