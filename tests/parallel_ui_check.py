"""Two conversations at once, without tabs.

Collie could hold exactly one thought. `openSession` and `newThread` both began `if (running) return`
— while a run was going the sidebar was inert and the only ways out were to wait or to stop the work.
That guard was honest at the time, because a run really did die when its socket went away; the fix
that made runs outlive their window is what makes leaving one safe.

What has to be true for a second thread to be worth starting: leaving does not cancel, the list says
which threads are working without this window having to be the one watching, and a finished run
reports whether the gate actually verified it — that verdict is the whole point of running several,
since it is the only thing that says which results deserve your attention first.
