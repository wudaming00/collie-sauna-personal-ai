"""A face per dog (harness/avatar.py).

The premise is identity, so the test that matters most is not "does it draw" but "does the SAME
name give the SAME face" — a dog whose avatar changes on reinstall is worse than one with no
avatar. The rest pins the two claims the design rests on: the eyes really are the pair of fills
this recolours, and geometry is never touched.
