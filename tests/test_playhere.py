"""desktop.play_here — music that comes out of the computer you asked.

collie could already FIND music: yt-dlp resolves a stream in about a second. What it never did was
play it — `resolve_audio` handed the URL to whichever screen asked, so a client with no audio element
(a phone, `collie web` in a terminal) got a correct answer and silence.

Nothing here touches the network or makes a sound; the resolver and the player are both stubbed, and
what is checked is the decision-making around them.
