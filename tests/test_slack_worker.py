"""What `collie slack` actually does with an ask.

The bot passed the task as `--task`, which `collie run` takes positionally. argparse rejected it
with exit 2 before a single token was spent, so every ask ever accepted failed — while the thread
filled with "queued" and "on it" and looked exactly like work. Nothing downstream of the spawn was
ever checked against the parser that has to accept it, so this checks precisely that.
