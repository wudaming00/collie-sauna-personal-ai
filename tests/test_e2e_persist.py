"""K_dev survives a desktop restart, and a device whose key is gone is told so.

E2E_DESIGN.md §7 promises: "Desktop restart: K_dev persists (in the device store) → returning device
keeps working, no re-pair." The shipped code did the opposite — the keypair was per process, so every
`collie web` restart left every encrypted phone unable to open a single frame, surfacing as an opaque
5xx with nothing a person could act on. Both halves are pinned here: the key comes back, and when it
genuinely cannot, the answer says what to do about it.
