"""The now-playing control in collie's own UI — the one that exists on every platform.

macOS gets a menu-bar item and Windows a tray icon, but this pill is always there, and on Linux it is
the only control. What has to be true: it is invisible while nothing is playing, it appears with the
track when collie starts something, and clicking it actually stops the audio rather than only hiding
itself.

The first version failed the first of those. `[hidden]` loses to `.pill`'s `display:inline-flex`, so
the attribute was set and the pill stayed on screen anyway — an indicator that shows when nothing is
playing is worse than no indicator, and nothing about the markup looked wrong.

Needs a browser and a running `collie web`, so it runs directly rather than from run_all.sh:

    COLLIE_WEB=http://127.0.0.1:8996 COLLIE_TOKEN=<token> python3 tests/nowplaying_web_check.py
