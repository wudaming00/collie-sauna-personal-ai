"""The menu-bar control for whatever collie is playing — driven inside a real AppKit run loop.

The point of this control is that stopping the music must never require asking the agent again. So
what has to be true is: the item appears when playback starts, it says what is playing, clicking it
kills the player AND removes itself, and none of that crashes when it is driven from an HTTP worker
— which is where "stop the music" from the phone arrives.

That last one is not hypothetical. Touching NSStatusBar off the main thread took the whole app down
with a Trace/BPT trap and no traceback, twice, while this was being written.

Needs a window server, so it is not part of run_all.sh; run it directly:
