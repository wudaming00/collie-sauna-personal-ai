"""/api/repos must answer even when the filesystem will not.

Walking a home directory is not merely slow in the bad case — it BLOCKS. On macOS, ~/Music and
~/Movies are the Apple Music and TV libraries, and os.walk over one full of cloud placeholders never
returns. Measured on a real machine: discover_repos had not finished after five minutes, twice, and
an instrumented walk could not even reach its own timeout check because control never came back from
the OS.

What that looks like from outside: the phone's Code screen spins forever, and a server thread is
gone for good.

Two defences, and this pins both — the names that are known to do it are skipped, and the endpoint
has a deadline regardless, because the next one will have a different name.
