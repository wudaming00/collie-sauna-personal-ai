"""Nothing collie spawns may throw a console window at whoever is using the machine.

Reported from a desk, not from a log: "他不停的弹了好多好多框框，非常影响使用" — black boxes
flashing open across the screen while a dog worked. Every collie surface that matters runs under
pythonw (the Slack dog, the wallpaper, the desktop app), and a windowless parent on Windows gets
its children a BRAND NEW console each. A run doing twenty shell steps threw twenty windows.

The bug is not any one spawn — plat.no_window_kwargs() already existed and most callers used it.
The bug is that a spawn added later inherits nothing, and the failure is invisible to everyone
developing on macOS. So this walks the source rather than trusting a habit.
