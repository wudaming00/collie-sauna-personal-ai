"""One codebase, three platforms — this is the gate that keeps it true.

collie ships from a single repo: one `git tag` builds Collie-Setup.exe on windows-latest,
Collie-arm64.dmg on macos-14 and the wheel on ubuntu. That property does not survive on its own.
It broke silently and stayed broken for two releases, because Windows-only calls were written
inline in shared modules and wrapped in `except Exception`, so on macOS they returned False
instead of raising:

    launch()          os.startfile          -> could not open any app, ever
    open_project()    %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Code   -> could not open any project
    _seed_apps()      C:\\ paths             -> launcher was empty
    icon_png()        PowerShell + .NET     -> every icon fell back to a letter
    _ensure_ytdlp()   downloads yt-dlp.exe  -> an 18MB PE32+ binary on a Mac
    (14 call sites)   creationflags=        -> ValueError on every non-Windows call

Six features, one failure mode, zero error messages. None of them were found by reading the code;
they were found by running it on a Mac for the first time.

So: platform-specific APIs belong in harness/plat.py, behind a helper. Anywhere else they must sit
inside an explicit platform branch. This test fails on the code as it was before those fixes, which
is the only evidence that it is worth having.
