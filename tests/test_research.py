Deterministic — no live model or browser: a fake runner returns a canned cited
answer, and the done-check re-fetches the citations against a local fixture
server (SSRF guard opted-out for loopback). Proves: reachable citation ->
VERIFIED, no citation -> INCONCLUSIVE, and citations are extracted + a report is
