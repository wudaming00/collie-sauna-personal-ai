"""Run one browser suite against a `collie web` started just for it.

steer_ui_check and parallel_ui_check both need a live server AND a browser, and both take the server
from the environment so they can be pointed at a running one by hand. That makes them awkward to
call from run_all.sh, which has neither — and a suite that is awkward to call from the suite runner
is a suite nobody runs.

The server it starts is its own: a temp settings file on the mock provider and a temp sessions dir,
so it can never talk to the user's real Collie or leave anything in their history.
