"""Connecting a service should not start with "go and find its URL".

Asked to connect Slack, Collie reached for `@modelcontextprotocol/server-slack` — a stdio server
wanting a bot token and a team id you mint by hand in Slack's admin UI — and the Settings panel
opened with a form asking for a URL or a command line. Meanwhile Slack runs a remote endpoint that
does OAuth in a browser, and Collie has had the full handshake (2.1, PKCE, dynamic registration)
the whole time. The missing piece was never the capability. It was the address.

Every entry in CATALOG was probed and answered `401` with a `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` challenge,
which is what an endpoint that will do the browser handshake looks like. This test does not re-probe
the network — a suite that fails when Stripe has a bad afternoon is a suite people learn to ignore —
it checks the shape those probes established, and that lookup is forgiving enough to survive how
people and models actually type.
