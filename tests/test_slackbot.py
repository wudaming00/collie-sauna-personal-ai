"""What can be checked without a Slack workspace.

The live half — the WebSocket, the ack, the round trip — needs tokens and is not
mocked here: a fake Slack would only prove the fake agrees with itself. What is
worth pinning is everything that decides *behaviour* once it does run: the
identity a channel sees, the queue surviving a restart, and the ask surviving the
mention, because each of those fails silently. Slack redelivers any envelope not
acked within three seconds, and a duplicated run is invisible until it has
already done the work twice.
