"""The native app window must be pointed at the port the server ACTUALLY bound.

`webapp.main` scans forward when the asked-for port is busy — and used to keep the port it settled on
to itself. `collie app` asked for 8787, the server bound 8791, and the window was pointed at 8787: a
dead port. What that looks like is an app that opens, bounces in the Dock and shows nothing, and
relaunching makes it worse, because the abandoned server keeps its port and the next one moves
further along. Every symptom points at the window; none of them is the window.
