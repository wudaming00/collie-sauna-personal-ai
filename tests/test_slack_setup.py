"""Provisioning a pack: `collie slack setup` (harness/slackbot.py).

Slack's identity model is one app = one bot user = one @handle, so several dogs that can be
addressed separately need an app each. These checks pin the shape that makes that affordable and
installable, and the refusals that keep a half-provisioned dog from looking ready.
