# Install

Pick the path that matches you. Windows and Apple-silicon Mac users can install a packaged app; a
Linux user or developer can use **pip**.

## Windows — one-click installer (for everyone)

The friendliest path: no Python, no terminal, no configuration.

1. Download **`Collie-Setup.exe`** from the [latest release](https://github.com/colliehq/collie/releases/latest).
   Release installers are signed with Azure Artifact Signing; the release workflow verifies the
   Windows trust chain before publishing the file.
2. Double-click it. The installer itself is localized in Simplified/Traditional Chinese, English,
   Spanish, and many other languages. Collie's workbench currently offers English, Simplified
   Chinese, and Traditional Chinese.
3. Click through. When it finishes, open **Collie** from the Start menu or the desktop icon.
4. On first launch, **pick a brain**: an existing Claude, Codex, or Grok subscription connects in one
   click, or paste an API key. That's it.

Everything Collie needs ships inside the installer — an embeddable Python, the semantic-memory
engine, the desktop window (WebView2), and the browser extension. It installs per-user (no admin
prompt) and cleanly uninstalls from *Add or remove programs*. During an upgrade, Setup keeps the
previous bundled runtime until the new install succeeds and restores it if copying is cancelled or
fails; your `~/.collie` settings, memory, and missions are outside that replacement boundary.

!!! tip "Optional extras during setup"
    Two checkboxes let you turn on the **live star-map wallpaper** and the **real-browser bridge**
    at logon. Both are off by default and covered in [The desktop app](desktop.md).

## macOS — signed app

1. Download **`Collie-arm64.dmg`** from the [latest release](https://github.com/colliehq/collie/releases/latest).
2. Open the disk image and drag **Collie** to Applications.
3. Open Collie and choose a model provider. Release builds are signed with an Apple Developer ID and
   notarised; the packaged app currently targets Apple silicon and macOS 12 or newer.

### Homebrew status

The repository includes a checksum-verifying Homebrew release helper, but the public Collie tap is
not published yet. Use the DMG or the source install below; a copied
`brew install wudaming00/collie/collie` command will fail until maintainers publish that tap. The DMG
is also the better desktop choice when you want Collie's own macOS identity for Automation, Screen
Recording, Camera, and Microphone permissions.

## Linux and developers — pip / uv

Python 3.10 or newer is required. The core is stdlib-only, so the base install is tiny.

```bash
# from source (PyPI publish is planned):
git clone https://github.com/colliehq/collie && cd collie
pip install -e ".[local,dev]"
```

Then let Collie finish provisioning itself:

```bash
collie setup     # installs optional deps, pre-downloads the memory model, picks a provider
collie           # opens the terminal chat
```

### Optional extras

| Extra | What it adds |
|---|---|
| `local` | Semantic memory — granite-107m via onnxruntime (~55 MB, multilingual). What `collie setup` installs. |
| `tui` | The rich terminal chat (`collie tui`). |
| `browser` | Playwright — only for `collie browser-bridge --browser` (a managed Chromium with the extension preloaded, for CI / no-login use). The everyday real-browser control uses your own Chrome + the extension and needs no extra. |
| `search` | Keyless web search (DuckDuckGo). |
| `acp` | Editor integration over the Agent Client Protocol (`collie acp`). |
| `fastembed` | Opt-in jina-v3 and other fastembed models. |

```bash
# run from the cloned checkout above
pip install -e ".[local,tui,search]"
```

!!! note "Semantic memory is optional"
    Without the `local` extra, memory runs on **BM25 keyword recall** — it works out of the box, it
    just isn't semantic. Collie never silently falls back to a low-quality embedder.

## Verify it works

```bash
collie selftest      # $0 deterministic end-to-end: mock model, real tools + memory + dashboard
```

If that prints a green verified run, you're set → **[Quickstart](quickstart.md)**.
