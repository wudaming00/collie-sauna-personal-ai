"""Paired, repeated, memory-isolated harness comparison.

Why not "run SWE-bench Verified and report a number":

  * Verified is contaminated. OpenAI stopped reporting it: frontier models reproduce gold patches
    verbatim from the task id alone, >60% of its 138 problematic tasks are unsolvable through test
    defects, and independent work measures ~33% of successful patches involving solution leakage
    with file paths recalled up to 76% of the time. A score there measures model memory.
  * A single number is not falsifiable anyway. Harness choice alone moves SWE-bench results by
    10-20 points on identical weights, and the five SWE-bench variants are not comparable to each
    other — so "we scored X" invites "on which variant, which harness, which model", and all three
    swing it more than any difference we could claim.
  * Our own history is the argument against it: earlier runs are remembered as "well behind CC,
    Hermes and Pi", and there is no record left in this repo to check. Numbers with no trace are
    worse than no numbers.

So this measures the thing that survives contamination: the SAME instance through every selected
product, repeated, reported per instance rather than as a total.  The subscription-native run is
explicitly a PRODUCT comparison: Collie and Claude Code use Opus, while Codex uses its native Sol
route.  It says which purchasable system solved the task; it cannot isolate a pure harness effect.

MEMORY IS THE TRAP THIS FILE EXISTS TO AVOID. Collie remembers across runs and Claude Code does
not, so a repeated instance is exactly where Collie starts answering from its own notes rather
than from the repo. That already happened once here: an earlier experiment's runs shared a project
and a store, and the agent reported "result unchanged from the previous runs" about a repository it
had never looked at. Every run below gets its own COLLIE_STATE_DIR and its own project name, and
`verify_isolation()` proves it against a real fork before any quota is spent.

Only the cold condition is implemented here: every attempt gets fresh state.  A previously exposed
``collie-warm`` arm did not consolidate or retain a memory-writing tool, so its shared directory was
empty and the label was false; it is rejected until a real cross-task memory contract exists.
