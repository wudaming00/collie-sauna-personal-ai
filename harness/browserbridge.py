"""LLM-controllable browser — drive the user's REAL (logged-in, headed) browser from the agent.

web_search returns snippets, but many tasks need the model to DRIVE a browser: open an
authenticated page, click through, and read the FULL page — using the user's own session
(cookies/login), not a fresh sandbox. This is that bridge.

Architecture (MV3-friendly, no native messaging):
  model calls browser_open/read/click/type/links
      -> POST /enqueue {cmd} to the bridge server, block on the result
  a Chrome EXTENSION in the user's real browser long-polls GET /poll, runs the command in the
  active tab (chrome.scripting), then POST /result {id,data} -> unblocks the tool.

Run the server:  collie browser-bridge         (persistent; the extension polls it)
Load the extension: harness/browser_ext/ (see docs), then set COLLIE_BROWSER_BRIDGE=1 so the
browser_* tools register in a collie run and talk to the server over localhost.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- auth -----------
# Anyone who can reach 127.0.0.1 can reach this bridge, and this bridge drives the user's REAL
# logged-in browser with trusted input. The Origin/custom-header gate below stops WEB PAGES; it stops
# no local process at all, because `X-Collie-Bridge` is not a secret — any program running as this
# user can set it. A bearer token is the shape this whole category settled on (Kimi WebBridge ships
# `--auth-token` + `Authorization: Bearer`, with a `--dangerously-omit-auth` escape hatch).
#
# BE PRECISE ABOUT WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, because the next person to read this — including a future
# collie — will otherwise treat an authenticated bridge as a safe one:
#   · the token lives in a file THIS user can read, so malware running as this user reads it too;
#   · and it does not even need to. Such malware can just run the collie CLI and ask IT to do the
#     same thing, which no amount of authenticating the caller can prevent.
# What this buys is one step, and it is worth having: "anything that scans port 8677" becomes
# "something written specifically against collie". Defences that survive a local compromise need an
# anchor malware cannot forge — a human gesture in trusted browser UI, a second device, or a browser
# profile with no payment ability. None of those are implemented here.
