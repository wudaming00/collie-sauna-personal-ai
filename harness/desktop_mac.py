"""collie's live desktop on macOS — the real one, behind the Finder icons.

Windows pins a WebView2 window under Progman. macOS has no Progman; it has window LEVELS, and the
SDK puts kCGDesktopWindowLevel exactly 20 below kCGDesktopIconWindowLevel:

    kCGDesktopWindowLevel     = kCGMinimumWindowLevel + 20      (-2147483623)
    kCGDesktopIconWindowLevel = kCGDesktopWindowLevel  + 20      (-2147483603)

so a window parked at the first renders *under* the icons. Same outcome as Progman, different
mechanism — and it needs a real NSWindow, which no browser can provide (Chrome exposes no
window-level switch), so this is the one piece of collie's desktop that cannot be a browser window.

No compiler and no Xcode: PyObjC drives the same AppKit/WebKit objects a Swift app would, from
Python, which keeps this inside the one codebase instead of forking a native app.
    pip install collie-harness[desktop]

Clicks pass straight through to Finder (setIgnoresMouseEvents_), so the icons stay usable and the
wallpaper is a *view*. That costs nothing, because every way you actually talk to collie — the
terminal, `collie web`, the phone, an ACP editor — already drives the same live feed this page
renders. `--front` opts out and gives an ordinary interactive window instead.
