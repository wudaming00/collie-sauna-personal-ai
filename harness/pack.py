"""pack — best-of-N with EXECUTION-BASED selection.

collie's thesis is "don't trust the model's claim, run the code." Pack mode applies that to candidate
selection: run the task N independent times in isolated copies of the working tree, then pick the
winner by what actually PASSES — an optional check command (exit 0 = pass), then the harness's own
verification verdict (edited + a repro ran green), then a cheap quality tiebreak. Only the winning
tree is (optionally) copied back. If a check is given and NOTHING passes it, pack refuses to apply a
losing attempt — a no-op beats shipping a wrong edit.
