"""Isolated working trees, so two runs can touch the same repo without touching each other.

`pack` already isolates: it copies the tree to a temp dir, minus `.git` and the heavy directories.
That is right for best-of-N, where the attempts are disposable and only the winner is copied back.
It is wrong for work you intend to keep, and for the same reason twice: a tree with no `.git` cannot
be diffed, so the result arrives as a pile of changed files with no way to see what changed; and
there is no branch, so two results cannot be told apart, reviewed in order, or merged.

A git worktree gives both for free. Same history, separate checkout, its own branch — which is what
every other agent runner converged on this year, and what makes a finished run reviewable as a
branch instead of as an assertion.

What this is careful about:

- **Not every directory is a repo.** Falling back to the copy-based isolation would silently produce
  something unreviewable; falling back to the shared tree would silently let two runs collide. So
  `prepare` says which it got, and the caller decides.
- **A worktree with work in it is never removed.** `release` refuses while anything is uncommitted or
  the branch holds commits the main tree does not — the whole point was to keep the result.
- **The branch name comes from the session**, so an abandoned worktree can be traced back to the
  conversation that made it rather than being one of six `collie-tmp-*`.
