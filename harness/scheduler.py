"""Durable waiting + catch-up-on-wake — the colliejobd substrate (plan §5.2).

A delegate spends most of its life WAITING (a timer, an email, a page change).
Waiting must be durable state, not a live process (plan rule 8): the machine can
sleep or reboot. So a wait is a row on disk; on wake the daemon processes every
overdue wait (catch-up-on-wake), which on WSL2 is the honest semantics — the VM
stops when Windows sleeps, and we reconcile when it comes back, rather than
pretending to be 24/7.

The load-bearing, fully-tested piece is tick(now): fire every due wait by DRIVING
its action through the Executor (a reversible in-scope action runs; an
irreversible one parks in needs_you for confirm). serve() is a thin loop around
tick() for the daemon; the daemon holds no long-lived model process.

Timer waits are implemented here. Email/page-change waits need live credentials
and are the documented next step; they schedule the same way (a due predicate
instead of a fire_at), so this table is their substrate too.
