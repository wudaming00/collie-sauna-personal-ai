"""The Inbox — where a question waits when the person who has to answer it is elsewhere.

A run needs a human for one of two things: an approval, or an answer. Whether they are
sitting at the terminal or out of the house, it is the SAME record — parked, awaitable,
and resolvable from any surface. Only the visibility differs:

    VIS_INLINE   someone is attending this run; the prompt appears where they are
    VIS_INBOX    nobody is; it joins the cross-session queue and the phone gets a nudge

Keeping one record instead of two code paths is the whole trick. It means "unattended"
never becomes a second, laxer policy — it only changes who can reach the answer. The
autonomy ceiling is the gate's mode; this module has no opinion about it.

The contract that makes answering from anywhere safe: an item goes ``pending -> resolved``
exactly once, first responder wins, and later attempts are no-ops rather than errors. The
desktop dialog, the web card and a reply from a phone can race; the loser is simply told
nothing happened. collie already solved this shape once for device pairing
(remote.py `_ask_on_screen`) — this is the same rule written down.

Storage is its own SQLite file rather than a table inside actions.db. The main loop's
approvals are deliberately NOT actions.py propose/confirm records: that path is a step
BOUNDARY (the proposing step stops and the run exits `needs_you`), which is right for a
delegated job and wrong for a coding run that may click twenty times. Nothing here shares
a transaction with that store, so sharing its file would only couple two sets of
migrations.
