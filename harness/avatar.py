"""A face for each dog, derived from its name.

A dog is an identity — a name, an address, something you can @ — so it needs a face, and the face
has to be the SAME face everywhere. That rules out `random`: it must come out identical on this
laptop, on the mac, after a reinstall, and in the channel where colleagues have learned to
recognise it. The only entropy is sha256(name), sliced into fields.

What varies is colour, never geometry. The silhouette is what makes it a collie; recolouring within
fixed roles keeps every variant obviously the same breed, and the logo cooperates — it is a
low-poly trace whose 23 paths are flat fills of straight segments, with the two eyes as their own
addressable pair.

Sizes decided the palette, not taste. Rendered at the sizes Slack actually draws a bot avatar
(20px in the member list, 36-48px beside a message), a lightness-preserving coat tint is invisible.
The optional background plate carries identity at those tiny external sizes. First-party Collie UI
uses the same deterministic coat without the plate: the dog belongs in the surface, not on a
coloured app-icon tile.

Stdlib only, because collie's core is (`dependencies = []`): the PNG encoder is zlib + struct, and
the rasteriser is a scanline fill, which is enough because every path in the logo is straight
segments with no stroke, curve or gradient.
