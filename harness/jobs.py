"""Job — the delegate's core object, and the registry the executor consults.

verifier.py decides if an outcome happened; observe.py gets the evidence;
actions.py gates and performs one irreversible action. This ties them to a
durable Job (the plan's object #1) with an honest state machine, and a
Capability registry so the model-free executor can run a CONFIRMED action by
name — which is what makes `collie confirm <nonce>` possible: the human approves,
and host code (not a model) looks up how to execute and verify.

State machine (only the orchestrator moves a job; a model never marks itself done):

    queued -> running -> waiting  (durable wait: timer / email / page change)
                 |          |
                 |          +----> needs_you  (a gated action or a blocker)
                 |
                 +----> done_verified   (fresh independent evidence satisfied the check)
                 +----> done_accepted   (human eyeballed it; NO machine evidence)
                 +----> failed          (evidence refuted, or an unrecoverable blocker)
                 +----> cancelled

The verified/accepted split is load-bearing: an action whose done-check came
back INCONCLUSIVE (could not observe) or that was only human-eyeballed can reach
done_accepted at most — never done_verified. The ledger counts only verified.
