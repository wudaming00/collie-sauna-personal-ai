"""Experimental Claude Agent SDK transport for Collie's model loop.

The SDK is deliberately isolated in a short-lived worker process.  The core

is configured as a one-message reasoner with every foreign tool surface empty.
Collie still owns the system prompt, tool protocol, loop, and request budget.
