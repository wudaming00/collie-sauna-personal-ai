"""Collie Remote — the desktop side of "control your desktop Collie from your phone".

Topology (see docs design): the desktop is behind NAT, so it dials *out* to a public relay
(a Cloudflare Worker at collie.run) over one WebSocket; the phone talks to the same relay over
HTTPS; the relay multiplexes the phone's HTTP requests onto the agent WS.

This module is the relay *client*. The elegant part: it is just a **local client of our own
127.0.0.1 web server** — it replays each incoming request to http://127.0.0.1:<port>/... with the
per-process CSRF TOKEN injected. So webapp.py's `_host_ok` (Host is loopback) and `_authed` (token
present) are satisfied untouched, and the local security model keeps holding. The local TOKEN never
leaves the machine; the phone authenticates one layer up, at the relay.

Hosted-remote protocol v2 is fail-closed E2E.  A QR fragment carries a 256-bit secret and this
desktop's X25519 public key; URL fragments never reach the relay.  The phone sends only an HMAC proof
over the key transcript, which this process verifies before a human approves the device.  Every API
request then uses one fixed outer endpoint and an encrypted inner method/path/query/body.  Plaintext
requests from a hosted relay are deliberately rejected; see harness/e2e.py and relay/E2E_DESIGN.md.
