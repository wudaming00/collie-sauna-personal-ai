"""Slack Socket Mode listener — @ a collie in a channel and it goes to work.

Why Socket Mode and not a webhook. Event Subscriptions need a publicly reachable
HTTPS URL, and the machines this runs on are laptops: behind NAT, asleep half the
day, on an address that changes with the café. That means a tunnel or a relay
Worker, which is two more things that can be down while looking fine. Socket Mode
inverts it — *we* dial out to Slack over a WebSocket and events arrive on that
connection. Nothing to expose, nothing to forward, and a laptop that changes
networks just reconnects.

Zero third-party dependencies, like the rest of the core (`dependencies = []` in
pyproject): the WebSocket half is `harness/wsclient.py`, already written for the
remote relay, and the Web API half is four `urllib` POSTs.

The identity question, and why the dogs have names. "collie-mac" and "collie-win"
stop working the moment two people both have a Mac, and they read like serial
numbers. A collie is a working dog and the pack is already in this codebase
(`collie pack`), so each instance is a dog with a name it keeps: `@Rowan` is the
one on a particular machine no matter what that machine is called, and a person
can hold that in their head. The name is chosen once, stored, and announced along
with where it lives and — this matters more than the name — **what it is allowed
to do**, so its autonomy is never something you find out afterwards.

# The kennel — provisioning a pack, one app per dog

# Slack's identity model is one app = one bot user = one @handle. There is no
# arrangement of a single app that gives `@rowan` and `@juno` their own
# autocomplete, their own mentions, and their own avatar — so a pack whose
# members can be addressed separately needs an app EACH. What makes that
# affordable is that an app can be created from a manifest over the API: the
# per-dog cost becomes one command instead of a tour through six settings pages.
#
# Bot-only, on purpose, and not as a simplification. The moment an app carries
# user scopes Slack switches on token rotation, and a rotating app cannot be
# installed from the button — it must go through an OAuth redirect, and Slack
# then refuses bot scopes on a loopback one ("Bot scopes are not allowed when
# redirecting to a non-web URI"). Three rules that close on each other, verified
# against the live endpoints. A bot-only app is the only shape that installs
# without the user owning a public https endpoint. The MCP side keeps its own
# app and its own user token; the two never share a credential.

# Every event carrying a `bot_id` used to be dropped, which made two dogs in one channel deaf to
# each other: BigMac's `@rowan hello` reached rowan's app and went in the bin. The reason was real —
# two bots answering each other's mentions is a loop that spends real money on every lap — but it
# also ruled out the thing a pack is for.
#
# "A reply mentions nobody, so it cannot re-trigger anyone" was true of the code and false of the
# job: being asked to @ another dog is the ordinary way work is handed on, and a dog that reports
# back to the dog that asked has to mention it or the answer goes nowhere. So mentions between dogs
# are the mechanism, and the loop has to be bounded by something that can tell a chain that is
# GETTING SOMEWHERE from a pair of dogs bouncing.
#
# Repetition is what distinguishes them. A delegation walks new ground — rowan asks juno, juno asks
# cap — and every step is an edge nobody has used in this thread. A loop re-walks one edge: rowan,
# juno, rowan, juno. So the rule is per-edge and not per-message: any one dog may reach this dog
# PACK_LAPS times in a thread, which leaves room for "here is the answer" and "thanks, one more
# thing" and stops the third identical lap. PACK_HOPS is the backstop for a long chain that never
# repeats an edge but has clearly stopped being useful.
#
# Both are per-thread, so a new thread starts clean: the bound is on one conversation going round,
# never on a pair of dogs speaking again.
