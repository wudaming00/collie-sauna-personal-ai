"""codemap — repo → a compact file map for the Map view (galaxy visualization).

Walks a working tree and, per source file, records the numbers the Map renders spatially:
  loc      lines of code              -> star size
  defs     top-level functions+classes-> planets (a star system's bodies)
  methods  nested methods             -> (reserved: moons)
  names    the def/class names        -> planet labels (click a star → see its functions)
  imports  internal modules it uses   -> gravity links between star systems
Grouped by top-level dir (`g`) so modules become nebulae. Python gets real AST parsing; other
languages fall back to a lightweight def/class scan so the map still populates. stdlib-only.

The web layer calls build_tree(cwd) for GET /api/tree; it is cached per (cwd, mtime-of-dir) at the
call site. Bounded (MAX_FILES) so a huge monorepo can't stall the request.
