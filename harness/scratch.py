"""Short-lived isolation for several agents working the same task at once.

pack runs N attempts at one task and picks the winner by what PASSES. That only means anything if
the N are independent samples. They were not: every attempt ran under the same `project`, the loop
consolidates its answer by default, and the composer auto-prefetches from memory — so attempt 2's
prompt arrived carrying attempt 1's conclusion, and best-of-N quietly degraded into serial
refinement. Measured, not theorised: attempt 1's system prompt contained
`RELEVANT MEMORY (auto-recalled): - Task 'pack0' -> <attempt 0's answer>`.

The fix is deliberately NOT "give each agent its own memory". Shared long-term memory is the
point — every member should start from the same accumulated knowledge about this repo, or the
members differ for a reason that has nothing to do with the model behind them. What must not be
shared is what a member writes WHILE it is running.

So reads fall through to the real store and writes land in an in-process overlay that dies with
the agent. There is nothing to clean up afterwards, nothing to forget, and no member can read
another's notes. It also makes the members safe to run concurrently, which is the point of giving
each one a different model.

A consequence worth stating: a losing attempt's answer never becomes a durable fact. That is the
intended reading — a candidate that was not selected is not something Collie learned.
