"""MCP client — let collie consume external MCP servers (filesystem, github, sqlite, …) as tools.

This is the payoff of the two-tier registry: an MCP server may expose dozens of tools, and putting
all their schemas in the cached prefix would wreck collie's lean-prompt advantage. So MCP tools go
in the DEFERRED tier — advertised by name only — and the model pulls a schema with `load_tools`
exactly when it needs one.

Two costs to keep low:
  • startup — we must know each server's tool NAMES to advertise them, but spawning every server on
    every `collie` launch is wasteful. So tool lists are CACHED (~/.collie/mcp_cache.json, keyed by a
    hash of the server's launch config); startup reads the cache and spawns nothing. A cache miss
    does one synchronous list (and caches it).
  • per call — a server process is spawned LAZILY on the first tool call and then reused for the rest
    of the session (pooled by server name).

Transports (two, chosen per-server by config shape):
  • stdio  — JSON-RPC 2.0 over a spawned process's stdin/stdout, newline-delimited (NOT LSP framing).
  • remote — Streamable HTTP (spec 2025-03-26): one endpoint, JSON-RPC over POST, responses as JSON
    or a text/event-stream frame. Auth = a static `headers` block, or OAuth 2.1 (PKCE + dynamic client
    registration + loopback redirect) via `collie mcp login <name>`; tokens live in ~/.collie/mcp_tokens.json.

Config: ~/.collie/mcp.json (or $COLLIE_MCP_CONFIG):
    {"servers": {
       "fs":     {"command": "npx", "args": ["-y","@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem","/tmp"]},

       "custom": {"url": "https://x/mcp", "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer TOKEN"}}}}  # remote, static
No third-party deps — subprocess + json + threading + urllib only, on brand with collie.

# ---- the short list of servers you can just connect to ------------------------------------------
#
# Adding an MCP server used to mean knowing its URL, or knowing which npm package to spawn. Asked to
# "connect Slack", Collie reached for `@modelcontextprotocol/server-slack` — a stdio server that
# wants a bot token and a team id you have to go and mint in Slack's admin UI. Meanwhile Slack runs
# a remote endpoint that does OAuth: click, browser, authorize, done. The capability was already
# here (see login(), full OAuth 2.1 with PKCE and dynamic registration); what was missing was
# knowing the address.
#
# Every entry below was probed and answered 401 with a WWW-Authenticate: Bearer challenge, which is
# what an MCP endpoint that will do the browser handshake looks like. Anything that cannot be
# checked that way does not belong here — a directory that lists a URL nobody verified turns "one
# click" into "one click, then a mystery".
#
# `byo_client` marks the ones a press CANNOT finish. Answering 401 with a Bearer challenge — the
# test every entry here passed — proves the endpoint speaks OAuth. It does NOT prove a client can
# register itself, and without RFC 7591 dynamic registration there is no client_id to authorize
# with. Slack, HubSpot and GitHub advertise no registration_endpoint (checked 2026-08-04 against
# their live metadata: Slack sends you to slack.com/oauth/v2_user/authorize with nothing to
# register against), so `connect` on those dies at "no client_id" — after adding the server, which
# is exactly how a press comes to look like it did nothing.
#
# They stay listed rather than removed: the address is still the thing you would otherwise go
# hunting for, and knowing you need your own OAuth app IS the answer to "why did that not work".
