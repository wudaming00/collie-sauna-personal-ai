"""research.web — research + decide, driving the user's real browser.

The plan's first-slice archetype #1 (research + decision). It runs collie's own
bounded agent loop with the FULL browser tool set against the user's real
logged-in Chrome (open/read/links + type/click/console/eval via the bridge) plus
keyless web_search/web_fetch — so it can actually USE interactive sites (fill a
finder form, click through) to produce a short, SOURCED answer. Only the local
file/shell mutators are dropped, so the browser is the sole actuator.

Its done-check is structural: the answer must declare findings (not NOFINDINGS),
carry a real cited URL, and follow the mandated Sources: format; cited-URL
re-fetch is an informational annotation, never a gate.

The agent run is injectable (`runner`) so tests are deterministic without a live
model or browser.
