"""What the gate decided, and why — a durable local record.

The question this has to be able to answer is not "what did collie do" (the session
transcript has that) but **"why was I not asked about that?"**. So the invariant is:

    every call that ran WITHOUT a prompt records the rule that let it through.

`project` mode, a repo allowance, a standing rule, an override, an explicit approval —
each writes the reason it applied. A row that says "allowed" and cannot say why would be
the one row you actually needed, so `reason` is not optional anywhere.

Arguments are sanitised on the way in. The loop already hands the gate PRE-redaction
arguments (placeholders, not credentials), and this adds a second pass for the shapes
that are sensitive by position rather than by value: what someone typed into a page, the
body of a message. Belt and braces, because an audit log is exactly the file people
forget is readable and mail to each other when something goes wrong.

Local only. Nothing here is sent anywhere; there is no collie server to send it to.
