#  ClaudeCliProvider — drive collie's backend with the LATEST Claude model through the
#  official `claude` CLI. This is the ONE sanctioned, non-proxy way to use a Max/Pro
#  SUBSCRIPTION programmatically (verified against Anthropic's own docs + the 2026 bans on
#  header-spoofing proxies): shell out to the real Claude Code binary as a narrow reasoner.
#  Two auth modes, both first-party/legitimate — pick by which env var you set:
#    • SUBSCRIPTION (dev/small runs): `claude setup-token` -> export CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN;
#      _call() drops ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from the child env so the subscription actually wins.
#    • API KEY (unattended full benchmark runs): export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (per-token, no
#      subscription rate-window, no ToS grey area).
#  Use model="opus" / "claude-opus-5" to break the DeepSeek resolve ceiling (proven
#  model-bound on SWE-bench). collie still runs its OWN loop/tools/memory/context; each turn
#  it delegates only "produce the next step" to `claude -p` with Claude Code's tools disabled
#  (pure reasoner), and a text tool-protocol lets the model drive collie's tools.
#
#  `--system-prompt-file` is a complete replacement for Claude Code's default system
#  prompt. Together with safe mode and an empty built-in tool set, this leaves Collie
#  in charge of the agent loop and gives the CLI only Collie's explicit contract.

    configured — do not save". It is how a provider that needs more than an exported env var (a
    pairing code, a device enrolment) can ask at the one moment the user is holding the answer,
    instead of failing on the first completion over a step nobody mentioned.
