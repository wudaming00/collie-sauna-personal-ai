"""Confirm-token + deterministic executor + receipts — the irreversible-action seam.

The verifier (verifier.py) decides whether an outcome happened; this module
decides whether an irreversible action is ALLOWED to happen and then performs it
WITHOUT a model in the loop. It is the §5.1/§5.2 spine of the delegate plan:

  1. A gated action never executes in the step that proposes it. The proposing
     step materializes the exact action (propose -> nonce) and stops; the run
     exits needs_you. State lives on disk, so it survives the proposing process
     dying (the whole reason the confirm boundary IS a step boundary).
  2. A human approves the materialized record (confirm(nonce)) — approving a
     concrete payload, not an English sentence.
  3. A deterministic executor (execute()) runs the approved action verbatim,
     runs the done-check, and writes a receipt. No model reasons here, so an
     injected page cannot talk the executor into a different action.

Six guarantees, each pinned by tests/test_actions.py:
  - single-use     an approved nonce fires the side effect AT MOST once (no double-send)
  - durable        propose/confirm survive process restart (on-disk SQLite)
  - payload-bound  the args are hashed at propose; tampering before execute is refused
  - TOCTOU-safe    if the world diverged from the approved snapshot, execute refuses
  - fail-closed    an unconfirmed (merely proposed) nonce cannot execute
  - evidenced      every execution writes a receipt carrying the done-check verdict

The side effect and the done-check are INJECTED (side_effect_fn, donecheck_fn),
so this layer is fully testable with a counter + a fixture and performs no real
irreversible action itself.
