"""Context composition — the pain-#2 / pain-#4 machinery.

The system prompt is assembled from three cache-ordered tiers:

  STABLE   identity + language/grounding rules + mode role
           + tool NAMES + skill manifest                          (rarely changes)
  CONTEXT  merged project rules (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md), char-capped
  VOLATILE core memory blocks + AUTO-PREFETCHED memory + timestamp  (LAST)

Volatile goes last so per-turn churn never invalidates the cached prefix above it.

AUTO-PREFETCH is the key move the internalized embedding unlocks: every turn we
run a cheap local hybrid recall on the user's message and inject the top hits into
VOLATILE — so the model never has to *decide* to search (that decision is why
Claude Code / echomem sit at ~1% recall activation). Retrieval is also still
available as an explicit tool for deeper digs.

TokenBudgeter reports per-section cost (like `/context detail`) and enforces a
fixed-prefix ceiling.

    was, and by spending two turns asking questions it could have answered itself, delivering
