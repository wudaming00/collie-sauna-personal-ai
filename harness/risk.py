"""Risk classes for tools — the declared side-effect category the gate reads.

Risk is DATA, in one auditable table, not a predicate scattered across the tools. You
can read this file and know the whole policy; that is the point of keeping it here
rather than as a flag on each Tool subclass.

Four classes, ordered by what they can reach:

  read          no side effect anywhere            — always allowed
  write_local   mutates this machine's files       — scoped to the writable roots
  exec          runs a command on this machine     — mode-gated
  external      an effect that LEAVES this machine — the part that needs a human

`external` is the one that matters for collie specifically. A cloud agent's worst
case is a bad edit; collie drives the user's REAL logged-in browser and their real
desktop, so `browser_click` can send mail, post, buy, or delete — under their cookies,
with no further authentication. That is the boundary this module exists to name.

TWO THINGS ARE DELIBERATE AND EASY TO GET WRONG:

1. The fallback is EXTERNAL, not READ. collie's tool set is not closed — MCP servers
   register tools at runtime, `enable_capability` adds more mid-session, and provider
   plugins can ship their own. An unclassified tool must fail CLOSED. (A closed-set
   agent can afford to default to read; we cannot.)

2. Browser and desktop risk depends on the ARGUMENTS, not the tool name. `browser_click`
   on a nav link and `browser_click` on "Send" are the same tool with the same schema.
   So the unit of authority here is (tool, target) — see `target_for` — where the target
   is the page origin or the app. "Always allow browser actions on localhost:5173" is
   expressible; "always allow browser_click" deliberately is not.
