"""Mandate compiler — natural language in, a structured job out (plan §5.2).

This is the delegate's front door: the user says what they want in plain words;
host code (optionally with the model) turns it into ONE concrete job — a
registered capability + its args + a leash — which the executor then drives. It
never invents authority: the leash it proposes is scoped to the chosen
capability's family, and an irreversible capability still parks for confirm.

Two paths, so the NL box works regardless of model availability:
  - model path: the configured provider picks a capability from the REGISTERED
    set and fills args as strict JSON.
  - heuristic fallback (no provider / model error / bad JSON): a note-taking
    request maps to note.append; anything else asks a clarifying question.

The compiler only ever selects a capability that is actually registered, so it
cannot propose something the executor can't safely run.
